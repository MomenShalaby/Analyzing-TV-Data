# Analyzing-TV-Data
Data Analysis project by DataCamp.
I applied my Python skills in real-world data analysis, In this notebook, I loaded, cleaned, then explored Super Bowl game, television, and halftime show data. I visualized the distributions of combined points, point differences, and halftime show performances using histograms. I used line plots to see how ad cost increases lagged behind viewership increases. And I discovered that blowouts do appear to lead to a drop in viewers.
